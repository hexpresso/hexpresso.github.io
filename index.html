                <h3>Hexpresso is back !</h3>
                <p>Hi folks,
                Long time no see!
                We were all a bit busy, but we are giving you some news!<br>
                On july 28th took place the qualification for the real world ctf. This CTF was just amazing.<br>
                It was an Online Jeopardy where All challenges were built on top of real world applications.<br>
                @HexpressoCTF ended in the TOP20. Xer, @Bitk_ and @SakiiR did the job.<br>
                We received three weeks ago our invitation letter to join the on-site qualifications.<br>
                The finals will be from the 1st to 3rd on December 2018.<br>
                After some internal discussions, we decided to send these 5 persons to Shengen:<br>

                <h3>Hexpresso is now on Github !</h3>
                <p>We have decided to migrate to Github for many reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wordpress is not really pleasant to use,</li>
                    <li>Github is simpler to sort our write-ups by CTF,</li>
                    <li>Github allows us to create and modify very easily our WU, by merging using git,</li>
                    <li>People reading our WU will be able to clone our repo which might contains binaries, pictures, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                So now, we will slowly migrate all our WU from <a href="https://hexpresso.wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> to our <a href="https://github.com/hexpresso">Github</a>. <br>
